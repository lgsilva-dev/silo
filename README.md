# Silo Capacity Analysis and Forecast

#### Context:

This project focuses on analyzing soybean storage in silos to optimize logistics, reduce costs, and improve supply chain efficiency. The focus is on better understanding silo storage capacity and bringing up key factores that may help predict when refilling is needed, ensuring better inventory management and and mitigating potential risks.

**Key Insights & Benefits**

* September to January is the planting and harvest period in Palotina, PR. During this time, silos are filled as soybeans are harvested, and trucks transport the crop to other locations.

* Reduce dependency on expensive sensor technology by leveraging historical trends to predict when silos will be low on stock.

* Improve efficiency by scheduling refills and transportation based on data-driven predictions.

**Questions This Analysis Can Answer**

* On which days of the week or month is a silo likely to have less than 10% of its capacity filled?

* How does harvest seasonality impact silo storage trends?

* What is the ideal time to schedule refilling operations for optimized logistics?

**DISCLAIMER:** The dataset used simulates soybean storage dynamics in Palotina, Paran√°, Brazil, over a five-year period, providing insights into silo capacity, filling trends, and depletion rates. A synthetically generated dataset can be useful to learn about the problems and help to mitagate solutions, real data will diverge from this though and won't be so consistent due to natural variations such as weather, transportation delays, operational inconsistencies and many others.
